# Navigation Simulation: Kalman Filter vs Particle Filter

This project evaluates and compares the performance of two widely-used localization methods in robotic navigation: the **Kalman Filter** and the **Particle Filter**. Simulations will assess their accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in various scenarios.

## Project Objectives
1. Implement the Kalman Filter and Particle Filter algorithms in Python.
2. Simulate robotic navigation using both algorithms under controlled conditions.
3. Analyze performance metrics such as computational efficiency, accuracy, and reliability.
4. Provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method.

## How to Run Simulations
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dgoldberg1900/finalProject.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the `src` directory**:
   ```bash
   cd finalProject/src
   ```
3. **Run the simulation**:
   ```bash
   python simulation_runner.py
   ```
